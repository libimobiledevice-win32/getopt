getopt port for Windows
=======================

This repository contains a port of getopt which can be used with Visual C++ and clang on Windows. It is intended to be used with vcpkg and Conan.

The Visual C++ port was originally done by Ludvik Jerabek, and described in the [Full getopt Port for Unicode and Multibyte Microsoft Visual C, C++, or MFC Projects](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/157001/Full-getopt-Port-for-Unicode-and-Multibyte-Microso/)
article. This repository contains a copy of that code and the article.
