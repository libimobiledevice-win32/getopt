Introduction
------------

This software was written after hours of searching for a robust Microsoft C and C++ implementation of getopt,
which led to devoid results.

This software is a modification of the Free Software Foundation, Inc. getopt library for parsing command line arguments
and its purpose is to provide a Microsoft Visual C friendly derivative. The source code provides functionality for both
Unicode and Multibyte builds and supports `getopt`, `getopt_long`, and `getopt_long_only`. Additionally the code supports the
`POSIXLY_CORRECT` environment flag. The library uses the `_UNICODE` preprocessor directive when defining the `getopt`, `getopt_long`,
and `getopt_long_only` functions. These functions are mapped back to `getopt_a`\`getopt_w`, `getopt_long_a`\`getopt_long_w`, and
`getopt_long_only_a`\`getopt_long_only_w` respectively. This improvement was made to allow a single DLL to be used in both
multibyte and Unicode projects.

The original GNU code used several header and implementation files containing numerous preprocessor directives specific
to Linux environments which have been removed. After removing unneeded dependencies, it was condensed into a single
header and implementation file which can be compiled into a DLL, LIB, or directly included into any Visual C, C++, or MFC
project. The getopt library can be used by proprietary software, however; certain measures need to be taken to ensure
proprietary code adheres to the Lesser GNU Public License for non-derivative works. Please refer to the licensing section
of this article for more details on how this software is licensed.

For the sake of brevity, this article doesn't discuss how to use the `getopt` functions. Anyone new to using the `getopt`
functions should refer to the GNU tutorial for using getopt.

Licensing
---------

Since `getopt` is licensed under LGPL, it is free to use in proprietary software under some restrictions.
When using this library as part of a proprietary software solution, it is important that the library is used as
a dynamically linked library (DLL) and is not statically linked or directly compiled into proprietary source code.
Static linkage requires that your software be released GPL. Therefore, by keeping the library separately referenced
via Dynamic Link Library (DLL), allows the DLL to be modified and updated without changing the proprietary software
which utilizes the library; under this condition proprietary software is said to "use" the library. Thus, it is not
considered to be a derivative work and can be distributed freely under any license.

Preprocessor Definitions
------------------------

Compiling `getopt` as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) requires the preprocessor definition of `EXPORTS_GETOPT`.
The definition of `EXPORTS_GETOPT` sets the internal preprocessor definition `_GETOPT_API` to the value `__declspec(dllexport)`.
Compiling getopt as a Static Library (LIB) or directly including the source and header file within a project requires the
preprocessor definition of `STATIC_GETOPT`. The definition of `STATIC_GETOPT` clears the value of the internal preprocessor definition
of `_GETOPT_API`. Compiling software to use _getopt.dll_ requires that no library specific preprocessor definitions be used.
When no library specific preprocessor definitions are used the value assigned to the internal preprocessor definition `_GETOPT_API` is `__declspec(dllimport)`.

The code segment below demonstrates the logic outlined above:

```c
#if defined(EXPORTS_GETOPT) && defined(STATIC_GETOPT)
    #error "The preprocessor definitions of EXPORTS_GETOPT 
        and STATIC_GETOPT can only be used individually"
#elif defined(STATIC_GETOPT)
#pragma message("Warning static builds of getopt violate the Lesser GNU Public License")
    #define _GETOPT_API
#elif defined(EXPORTS_GETOPT)
    #pragma message("Exporting getopt library")
    #define _GETOPT_API __declspec(dllexport)    
#else
    #pragma message("Importing getopt library")
    #define _GETOPT_API __declspec(dllimport)
#endif
```

The following code segment located in _getopt.h_ is responsible for mapping the correct version of the `getopt`, `getopt_long`,
and `getopt_long_only` functions. The `getopt` functions appended with `_a` to denote ANSI characters using the char type and
Unicode functions are appended with `_w` to denote wide characters using the `wchar_t` type.

```c
#ifdef _UNICODE
    #define getopt getopt_w
    #define getopt_long getopt_long_w
    #define getopt_long_only getopt_long_only_w
    #define option option_w
    #define optarg optarg_w
#else
    #define getopt getopt_a
    #define getopt_long getopt_long_a
    #define getopt_long_only getopt_long_only_a
    #define option option_a
    #define optarg optarg_a
#endif
```

Using the Code
---------------

The code is used identical to GNU `getopt`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "tchar.h"
#include "getopt.h"

int _tmain(int argc, TCHAR** argv)
{
    static int verbose_flag;
    int c;

    while (1)
    {        
        static struct option long_options[] =
        {
            {_T("verbose"), ARG_NONE, &verbose_flag, 1},
            {_T("brief"),   ARG_NONE, &verbose_flag, 0},
            {_T("add"),     ARG_NONE, 0, _T('a')},
            {_T("append"),  ARG_NONE, 0, _T('b')},
            {_T("delete"),  ARG_REQ,  0, _T('d')},
            {_T("create"),  ARG_REQ,  0, _T('c')},
            {_T("file"),    ARG_REQ, 0 , _T('f')},
            { ARG_NULL , ARG_NULL , ARG_NULL , ARG_NULL }
        };

        int option_index = 0;
        c = getopt_long(argc, argv, _T("abc:d:f:"), long_options, &option_index);

        // Check for end of operation or error
        if (c == -1)
            break;

        // Handle options
        switch (c)
        {
        case 0:
            /* If this option set a flag, do nothing else now. */
            if (long_options[option_index].flag != 0)
                break;
            _tprintf (_T("option %s"), long_options[option_index].name);
            if (optarg)
                _tprintf (_T(" with arg %s"), optarg);
            _tprintf (_T("\n"));
            break;

        case _T('a'):
            _tprintf(_T("option -a\n"));
            break;

        case _T('b'):
            _tprintf(_T("option -b\n"));
            break;

        case _T('c'):
            _tprintf (_T("option -c with value `%s'\n"), optarg);
            break;

        case _T('d'):
            _tprintf (_T("option -d with value `%s'\n"), optarg);
            break;

        case _T('f'):
            _tprintf (_T("option -f with value `%s'\n"), optarg);
            break;

        case '?':
            /* getopt_long already printed an error message. */
            break;

        default:
            abort();
        }
    }

    if (verbose_flag)
        _tprintf (_T("verbose flag is set\n"));


    if (optind < argc)
    {
        _tprintf (_T("non-option ARGV-elements: "));
        while (optind < argc) _tprintf (_T("%s "), argv[optind++]);
        _tprintf (_T("\n"));
    }
    return 0;
}
```
 
Using this Code with C++ Precompiled Headers
--------------------------------------------

When using this code statically within a C++ project with precompiled headers, it is necessary to rename `getopt.c`
to `getopt.cpp` in order to circumvent the following compiler error:

```
"C1853 - Precompiled header file is from a previous version of the compiler, 
or the precompiled header is C++ and you are using it from C (or vice versa)."
```

Additionally precompiled header file must be added as the first include of the `getopt.c` or `getopt.cpp` file.
For example, if you are using _stdafx.h_ as the precompiled header, the following would be expected:

```
// File comments removed
#include "stdafx.h"
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "getopt.h"
```
